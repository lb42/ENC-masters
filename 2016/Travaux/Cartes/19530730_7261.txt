I guess this is like
what you were too :-
Would like to see it some
time.  We didnt see it yet
You get around some too.
I never was to Jones beach.
Would like to some time:
We were to Phil on boat. But 
didnt get off - came back on
same boat xxx it was lovely
and cool on the water.
Ray  has had a bad sore throat
feels much better today - didnt stay
home. Hope you both are O K
Love from Emma & Ray
